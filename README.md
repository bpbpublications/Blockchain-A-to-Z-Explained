## About the Book
Blockchain has emerged as one of the most widely discussed technologies in the last few years among the students, practitioners, crypto enthusiasts and academicians alike. With Blockchain’s growing adoption, several new terms and lexicon are being added continuously to expand its universe comprising concepts, key contributors, latest developments, protocols, tools and lots more. We felt there was a need to introduce an all-encompassing ‘Blockchain Thesaurus’ that would enable practitioners and students to stay abreast of the ‘Who’, ‘Why’ and ‘What’ of the blockchain world as it stands today. With 400+ blockchain terms and growing, this book will address this requirement and equip the readers with all they want to know to become a blockchain pro.
 
Blockchain technology will soon power the currency for entire countries, change the world’s financial systems and level the playing field for small companies to have the same access to opportunities as the large incumbents. Yet little has been done to make the core concepts of blockchain accessible and understandable to the everyday business user. With this essential guide, Rajesh has made these powerful concepts real to everyone.
